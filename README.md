# D2D Python

## Description

This Python code is created to simulate the channel behaviour applying Aloha and CSMA protocols in a environment of devices performing direct link communication. 

The simulation has been created as a part of a thesis.

## How to use

main.py will run the D2D simulation based on the paths to the files with signal strength calculations. Please no that the path to the data and to the result file that will be created needs to be edited in the main.py file. The format of the data files can be implemented to readP2m.py depending on the source type.

After the command above has finished, analysis.py and plots.py can be run to create plots and a summery of the results in LaTeX.
